# Text Analysis of British Welfare Debates

### About 
This capstone project examines the motivations of British members of parliament (MP) for their role in the creation of a welfare state through a textual analysis of the rhetoric used during three specific parliamentary debates: National Health Service, Social Insurance Part 1 and 2, and Employment Policy. This project examines how MPs discussed introducing a welfare state in postwar Britain and their justifications for or arguments against its establishment. In past studies, historians have qualitatively assessed the origins of the welfare state, but there has been little quantitative study of these debates. This project quantitatively examines the rhetoric of MPs during the preliminary welfare debates through categorization and analysis.  

This project focuses on three British parliamentary debates that took place in 1944. In part, these debates occurred due to the introduction of the Beveridge Report to Parliament in November 1942, which provided a blueprint for social policy in Britain. The 1942 Beveridge Report was a forward-looking document that contained recommendations for the future of welfare in Britain. It has become central to modern debates about the origins of the welfare state and is renowned for its recommendations of universal welfare for all citizens. The report also attempted to redefine how the state interacted with the people by looking to establish a basis for a universal welfare initiative that included social insurance, health service and full employment.  

The Beveridge Report led to Parliamentary debates in the House of Commons discussing its contents as well as the future of the British welfare initiative and, in turn, prompted the government to issue the subsequent White Papers — a set of plans for post-war reconstruction regarding welfare. These White Papers, split into three parts and formally titled “A National Health Service,” “Social Insurance Part I and II,” and “Employment Policy,” outlined the government’s plan concerning health care, insurance and employment of its citizens.  In the 1944 House of Commons, these three White Papers inspired additional parliamentary debates on their named topics: national health, social insurance and employment policy. The parliamentary debates concluded when the Commons finally welcomed the government’s intention to create a comprehensive welfare scheme.
