# Text Analysis of British Welfare Debates

### About 
This capstone project examines the motivations of British members of parliament (MP) for their role in the creation of a welfare state through a textual analysis of the rhetoric used during three specific parliamentary debates: National Health Service, Social Insurance Part 1 and 2, and Employment Policy. This project examines how MPs discussed introducing a welfare state in postwar Britain and their justifications for or arguments against its establishment. In past studies, historians have qualitatively assessed the origins of the welfare state, but there has been little quantitative study of these debates. This project quantitatively examines the rhetoric of MPs during the preliminary welfare debates through categorization and analysis.
